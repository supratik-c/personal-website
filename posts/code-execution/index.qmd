# A Language for Data

In the world of analytics, statistics, and data science, two languages currently reign supreme: R and Python.

Both service a largely overlapping niche - people who want to move, manipulate, join and explore data. Python, of course, has far wider ranging applications from application/ web development to automation and R can be used for these things too! But R is one of the first languages developed primarily for mathematical, statistical and (later) machine learning applications.

This post will give a basic overview of this language, including some common libraries all data scientists will benefit from having in their toolkit.

```{r}
print("Hello, World!")
```
