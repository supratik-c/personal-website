Python, of course, has far wider ranging applications from application/ web development to automation and R can be used for these things too! But R is one of the first languages developed primarily for mathematical, statistical and (later) machine learning applications.\n\nThis post will give a basic overview of this language, including some common libraries all data scientists will benefit from having in their toolkit.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprint(\"Hello, World!\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"Hello, World!\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# \n",
